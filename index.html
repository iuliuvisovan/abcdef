<h1>PokemonSTOP! - Pokemon Go location hack</h1>
<div class="left">
    <h2>What is PokemonSTOP?</h2>
    <p><strong>PokemonSTOP</strong> is <strong>the best</strong> and most intelligent <strong>crack/cheat</strong> for
        the very popular
        <strong>Pokemon Go!</strong> mobile game. It lets
        you use the official <strong>Pokemon Go</strong> app to play the game just like everyone else does, but you’ll
        be able to set
        your <strong>position anywhere</strong> you like on the map,
        independent of your actual location. In other words, you won’t even have to stop shoveling those potato chips
        into
        your face to catch that rare Pokemon three towns over.
    </p>

    <h2>What does it actually do?</h2>
    <p><strong>PokemonSTOP</strong> manipulates and changes the <strong>location</strong> data your phone sends to the
        <strong>Pokemon
            Go!</strong> server,
        which in turn reveals the map of the location you sent, rather than the one you actually have. It also allows
        you to
        save
        location data you set in the past, so that you can use the location history manager to go back to where you have
        been,
        and save location data for important checkpoints inside the <strong>Pokemon Go!</strong> game.
    </p>

    <h2>How does it do it?</h2>
    <p><strong>PokemonSTOP</strong> uses low-level <strong>GPS API manipulations</strong> available in both Android and
        iOS phones' core,
        in
        order to trick the game
        into thinking you are somewhere where you are not. These GPS coordinates can be set at any point in the game and
        require
        a few seconds for them to update and reflect into the game itself. However you should not attempt to set a
        location
        too far away from your current position, and the movements you make should be as gradual as possible, as the
        <strong>Pokemon Go!</strong> server might detect that you are actually changing your coordinates in a unnatural
        way,
        and
        might/could realize you are cheating and kick you out/ban you. This being said, if you decide to use the hack,
        you
        should do it <strong>on
            your own responsibility.</strong><br/>
        (<i>Future versions of <strong>PokemonStop</strong> will be able to detect when the server is about to detect
            something unnatural and warn the player.</i>)
    </p>

    <h2>Why do I need a PC?</h2>
    <p><strong>PokemonSTOP</strong> uses the mobile operating system's internal GPS locating
        mechanisms.
        In order to be able to manipulate this, an application needs access to its core functionalities. Currently,
        neither Android nor
        iOS allow root core API access for its applications. By connecting to a PC
        you can manipulate this features without the mobile OS noticing it.
